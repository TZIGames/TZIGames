<h1>Hello World!</h1>
Nice to meet you, I'm Christopher C., but you can just call me Chris.  I'm the creator of Steampocalypse 1909, a boardgame developed, protoyped and produced in a litteral garrage. Over the past ten years I've been employed with the State of Oregon and the Texas Office of the Attorney General. Currently, I'm undergoing training as a full stack developer.
